description: MIS standard for project documentation. Covers Diataxis (Tutorials / How-to / Reference / Explanation) for user- and dev-facing docs, ADRs for decisions made, RFCs for decisions in flight, C4 model for architecture diagrams (Context, Container, Component), runbooks for operational procedures, blameless postmortems for incidents, keep-a-changelog for releases, READMEs as canonical entry points, and onboarding docs distinct from setup. Use whenever creating, updating, or reviewing any documentation in an MIS repo — code-adjacent docs, architecture diagrams, decision records, runbooks, postmortems, or onboarding material.

# MIS documentation standard

One opinion for every kind of doc that ships in an MIS repo. The goal is that any engineer (human or AI) opening the repo can find:

- **Why** decisions were made — ADRs.
- **What's still being decided** — RFCs.
- **How the system fits together** — C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component).
- **How to do specific things** — Diataxis (Tutorials, How-tos, Reference, Explanation).
- **What to do when alerts fire** — Runbooks.
- **What broke and what we learned** — Postmortems.
- **What changed in each release** — Changelog.
- **Where to start** — README → navigation tree.
- **How to become productive** — Onboarding.

| Topic                                   | Reference                              |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Diataxis quadrants — when to use each   | `references/DIATAXIS.md`               |
| ADRs — template, lifecycle, status flow | `references/ADRS.md`                   |
| RFCs — relationship to ADRs             | `references/RFCS.md`                   |
| C4 model — levels and tooling           | `references/C4_ARCHITECTURE.md`        |
| Runbooks — operational procedures       | `references/RUNBOOKS.md`               |
| Postmortems — blameless template        | `references/POSTMORTEMS.md`            |
| Where everything lives in a repo        | `references/REPO_LAYOUT.md`            |

Templates live in `assets/`.

## 1. Bootstrap docs in a new repo

Drop these into a new repo so it matches the MIS standard. The `docs/` tree organises by **purpose** at the top level (not by Diataxis quadrant):

```

Full layout discussion + naming conventions — `references/REPO_LAYOUT.md`.

## 2. Pick a Diataxis quadrant

Diataxis applies to user-facing / dev-facing docs. The four quadrants map to the MIS folder layout like this:

| Quadrant     | Reader is…   | Lives in                                                |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Tutorial     | Learning     | `docs/guides/` (numbered prefix: `01-getting-started.md`) |
| How-to guide | Working      | `docs/guides/` (descriptive kebab: `deploy-to-staging.md`) |
| Reference    | Working      | `docs/references/`                                       |
| Explanation  | Studying     | `docs/architecture/<topic>.md` (most explanations are architectural) |

Internal docs — ADRs, RFCs, plans, runbooks, postmortems — are **not** Diataxis.

Ask:

1. **Is the reader learning by doing?** → **Tutorial**. Hand-held, complete, predictable end state.
2. **Does the reader have a specific task in mind?** → **How-to guide**. Recipe. Assumes competence.
3. **Is the reader looking up specific facts (API, config, CLI)?** → **Reference**. Dry, exhaustive.
4. **Is the reader trying to understand why?** → **Explanation**. Discursive, opinionated.

Hard rule: **do not mix quadrants in one doc.** A tutorial that drifts into reference becomes useless to both audiences. Split it.

Full per-quadrant guidance + style notes — `references/DIATAXIS.md`.

---

## 3. Write an ADR

An **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) captures a decision **after** it has been made, with enough context that a future engineer can understand why.

Filename: `docs/decisions/<NNNN>-<short-kebab-name>.md`. Numbering is monotonic — never reuse.

Required sections (full template: `assets/template-adr.md`):

- **Title** — `ADR-NNNN: <decision>`
- **Status** — `proposed | accepted | superseded by ADR-MMMM | deprecated`
- **Context** — what is the issue we're seeing
- **Decision** — what we are going to do
- **Consequences** — positive, negative, neutral. What gets harder, what gets easier.
- **Alternatives considered** — what else we looked at and why we didn't pick it

Rules:

- **One decision per ADR.** If two decisions are tangled, write two ADRs that reference each other.
- **ADRs are immutable once accepted.** To change a decision, write a new ADR with `Status: supersedes ADR-NNNN`; mark the old one `superseded by`.
- **No "we'll think about this later" ADRs.** If the decision isn't made, it's an RFC (see below).
- **Link the ADR from any code / docs the decision affects** so the rationale is one click away.

Full lifecycle + status diagram — `references/ADRS.md`.

---

## 4. Write an RFC (and the plan that follows)

An **RFC** (Request for Comments) captures a decision **in flight**. It's where the team debates the merits before it becomes an ADR.

Filename: `docs/planning/rfcs/<NNNN>-<short-kebab-name>.md`. Separate numbering from ADRs.

Once an RFC is **accepted**, two artefacts follow:

- One or more **ADRs** in `docs/decisions/` capturing the specific decisions taken.
- An **implementation plan** in `docs/planning/plans/<NNN>-<short-name>.md` — the post-decision roadmap (phases, owners, milestones, rollback). Template: `assets/template-plan.md`.

A plan is **not** an RFC: the decision is made, the plan sequences the doing. Plans are time-bounded and get archived (kept, not deleted) once the work ships.

Required sections (full template: `assets/template-rfc.md`):

- **Title** — `RFC-NNNN: <proposal>`
- **Status** — `draft | review | accepted → ADR-MMMM | rejected | withdrawn`
- **Summary** — one paragraph: what and why
- **Motivation** — the problem and why now
- **Detailed design** — the proposal
- **Drawbacks** — what we lose by adopting this
- **Alternatives** — what else was considered
- **Open questions** — what we haven't resolved
- **Rollout plan** — how we'd ship it

When an RFC is **accepted**, it spawns an ADR (or several) summarising the decisions taken. The RFC stays as the public record of the deliberation; the ADR is the canonical decision.

When to write an RFC instead of an ADR:

- The change is large enough that you want feedback **before** committing.
- The decision affects multiple teams or services.
- There are credible alternatives and the team isn't aligned.

If you'd write the same content in either form, just write the ADR.

Full guidance — `references/RFCS.md`.

## 5. C4 diagrams

The MIS architecture diagramming standard is the **[C4 model](https://c4model.com/)**. We use three of its four levels — Level 4 (Code) is replaced by reading the code.

| Level | What it shows                                            | Audience                          | Lives in                                       |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **System Context** — your system as a box, users + external systems | Everyone (PMs, eng, leadership)   | `docs/architecture/c4/context.md`              |
| 2     | **Containers** — apps, services, databases, queues       | Engineering                       | `docs/architecture/c4/containers.md`           |
| 3     | **Components** — major modules inside one container      | Engineers working on that container | `docs/architecture/c4/components/<container>.md` |
| 4     | Code — usually skipped; read the code                    | (skip)                            | —                                              |

**"Container" predates Docker.** In C4 it means any independently runnable unit — a web app, an API service, a database, a queue, a Lambda. Mostly orthogonal to Docker containers.

### Tooling

- **Mermaid** with C4 syntax for diagrams checked into the repo (renders in GitHub). Templates in `assets/template-c4-context.md` and `assets/template-c4-container.md`.
- **Structurizr DSL** for repos that need the full C4 toolchain (workspace.dsl + cloud rendering). Optional; pick one per repo.

Rules:

- **Every repo has Level 1 + Level 2.** Level 3 is per-container, on demand.
- **One diagram per file.** Even if the file also has prose.
- **Annotate every line / box** — purpose, protocol (HTTPS / gRPC / SQL), datastore type.
- **Update the diagram when wiring changes.** Stale diagrams are worse than missing ones.

Full C4 reference + Mermaid syntax — `references/C4_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 6. Write a runbook

A **runbook** is the operational doc that fires when an alert pages someone or a known issue recurs. Optimise for the 3am-tired-oncall reader.

Filename: `docs/runbooks/<alert-or-symptom-kebab>.md`. Match the alert name if there is one.

Required sections (full template: `assets/template-runbook.md`):

- **Alert / symptom** — what triggers this runbook
- **Severity** — sev1 / sev2 / sev3 with definitions
- **Impact** — who/what is affected
- **Diagnose** — fast checks (dashboards, queries, logs) — links live, not just names
- **Remediate** — exact commands, in order
- **Verify** — how you know it's fixed
- **Escalate** — who to page if remediation fails, in priority order
- **Postmortem trigger** — when this incident requires a postmortem

Rules:

- **Runbooks are not how-tos.** A how-to assumes you can read at leisure. A runbook assumes you can't.
- **Every command is copy-pasteable.** No "edit X then run Y" — write both as separate steps.
- **Every link goes to the live thing**, not its name. "Check the API latency dashboard" → linked.
- **The author is on the hook for keeping it accurate.** A wrong runbook is worse than no runbook.

Full structure + examples — `references/RUNBOOKS.md`.

---

## 7. Write a postmortem

Every **sev1 / sev2** incident produces a postmortem within **5 working days**.

Filename: `docs/postmortems/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-summary>.md`. Date = day the incident started.

Required sections (full template: `assets/template-postmortem.md`):

- **Summary** — 3 sentences: what happened, impact, fixed by
- **Impact** — duration, users affected, revenue / SLA impact, data loss?
- **Timeline** — events in UTC. Detection, triage, mitigation, resolution, comms.
- **Root cause(s)** — use 5-whys or a fault tree. Multiple causes are normal.
- **What went well** — keep the team honest about successes
- **What went poorly** — system gaps, not personal failures
- **Action items** — each has an owner, a due date, and a tracker link
- **Lessons learned** — captured for the next on-caller

**Blameless rule.** Postmortems describe *systems* failing, not *people*. Replace "Alice deployed the bad change" with "the deploy pipeline allowed an unreviewed change to reach prod". If the writeup names a person as a cause, rewrite it.

Action items that fall out of postmortems often turn into ADRs (decisions to change something) and/or runbook updates (so the next on-caller is faster).

Full template + facilitation tips — `references/POSTMORTEMS.md`.

---

## 8. Update the changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` lives at the repo root and follows **[keep-a-changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)**.

Sections per release, in this order:

- `Added` — new features
- `Changed` — changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` — soon-to-be removed
- `Removed` — removed in this release
- `Fixed` — bug fixes
- `Security` — vulnerability fixes

```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New /export endpoint for CSV downloads.

### Fixed
- Logout no longer fails for users with > 5 sessions (MIS-318).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-12
### Added
- Stripe webhook retries with exponential backoff (MIS-142).
```

Rules:

- **Every PR that changes user-visible behaviour updates `[Unreleased]`.** Enforced in code review.
- **Versions are SemVer.** A breaking change bumps major.
- **Reference the ticket id** in parens, never the PR number — tickets outlive PRs.
- **`[Unreleased]` is rolled into the next dated section on release** by the release-promotion PR (see `mis-github-contribution`).

Template: `assets/template-changelog.md`.

---

## 9. Onboarding docs

`docs/onboarding.md` is the **day-1 → day-30 path** for a new engineer. It is **not** a setup guide — setup is a Diataxis how-to (`docs/guides/setup.md`).

Onboarding answers: who am I, who do I talk to, where do I read first, what do I work on, what does done-look-like in my first month?

Required sections (full template: `assets/template-onboarding.md`):

- **Welcome** — who reads this, what to expect
- **Day 1 checklist** — accounts, accesses, the local environment up and running
- **Week 1** — read these ADRs, run this tutorial, ship a tiny PR
- **Month 1** — ship a small feature end-to-end, attend an oncall shadowing
- **Who to ask** — by topic, with current handles (kept fresh)
- **Where to read** — links to architecture, ADRs, runbooks
- **Where to write** — link to this skill

Onboarding ages fast. **Re-read on every new hire** and update what's stale.

---

## 10. Review checklist

For any PR that touches docs, block on:

- [ ] Each new doc has a clear top-line statement of its role (which kind of doc it is).
- [ ] If it's user-facing, it lives in `docs/guides/` (tutorial / how-to) or `docs/references/` and stays inside one Diataxis quadrant.
- [ ] If it's an ADR, it has a number, a status, all required sections, and is linked from affected code/docs.
- [ ] If it's an RFC, it has open questions and a clear "what would make this accepted" framing.
- [ ] If it's an architecture change, the relevant C4 diagram is updated in the same PR.
- [ ] If user-visible behaviour changed, `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` is updated.
- [ ] If it's a runbook, every command is copy-pasteable and every link is live.
- [ ] If it's a postmortem, it is blameless (no named individuals as causes).
- [ ] Internal links use relative paths (`./adr/0001-…`) and resolve.

Comment-only (not blocking): prose style, headline wording, optional cross-references.

---

## Anti-patterns

- A README that lists every detail instead of pointing at where details live. The README is a hub.
- ADRs without a `Status` field. The lifecycle is the point.
- ADRs mutated to "update" a decision. Write a new ADR that supersedes.
- A doc that's half tutorial and half reference. Pick one quadrant.
- C4 Level 2 ("containers") used to mean "Docker containers". Read `references/C4_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Runbooks written in narrative prose. The 3am reader wants steps, not paragraphs.
- Postmortems that name people as causes. Always blame the system.
- `docs/` folders organised by team or service when the team / service later moves or renames. Organise by content type.
- A changelog entry per PR. The entry is per user-visible *change*, which may be many PRs or one.
- Diagrams as `.png` checked into the repo with no source. Use Mermaid (or commit the Structurizr DSL).
