# MIS LangGraph application standard

The contract for every MIS LangGraph repo:

1. **Project layout is two-tier.** Shared `services/` (API clients, integrations) sit alongside per-agent packages. Each agent is a self-contained Python package with consistent subfolders: `nodes/`, `prompts/`, `schemas/`, `tools/`, optional `eval/`.
2. **One graph per agent.** A single compiled `StateGraph` is the unit of deployment. `langgraph.json` registers each one.
3. **Nodes are pure functions** `(state, …) -> dict`. All I/O is funnelled through `tools/` or `services/`. Routing is in dedicated routing functions, not buried in node logic.
4. **State is typed and minimal.** A `TypedDict` (or Pydantic model) with explicit reducers. No "kitchen-sink" state.
5. **Deep agents use the harness primitives.** Multi-step / long-running agents adopt the Deep Agents harness — `write_todos` for planning, `task` for subagents, the virtual filesystem for shared scratch, declarative permissions, `interrupt_on` for HITL gates, persistent memory in `AGENTS.md`, and skills for progressive expertise loading.
6. **Tools have an approval boundary.** Side-effecting tools (send email, write to a calendar, post to Slack) are wrapped with `add_approval` outside of dev mode.
7. **Every module has a top-level docstring; every public function / node / tool has its own.**

## 2. Add an agent

1. Create the package: `src/<agent_name>/` with the full subfolder set (or copy the templates listed above).
2. Build the graph in `graph_builder.py` — see [section 5](#5-nodes-edges-routing).
3. Export the compiled graph from `<agent_name>.py`:
   ```python
   """Entry point for the <agent_name> graph. Imported by langgraph.json."""
   from <agent_name>.graph_builder import build_graph
   graph = build_graph()
   ```
4. Register in `langgraph.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "graphs": {
       "<agent_name>": "./src/<agent_name>/<agent_name>.py:graph"
     }
   }
   ```
5. Add unit + integration tests in `tests/` (see `references/TESTING.md`).
6. Document setup quirks in `docs/<AGENT>_SETUP.md` if any.

Naming:

- **Package & graph name:** `snake_case` noun describing the agent's role (`email_assistant`, `meeting_scheduler`, `research_agent`).
- **Node functions:** `snake_case` verb (`triage_email`, `draft_reply`, `route_after_tools`).
- **Tools:** `snake_case` verb (`send_email`, `read_inbox`, `add_event`).
- **Schemas / state classes:** `PascalCase` (`AgentState`, `TriageDecision`).

---

## 3. Add a shared service

A **service** is reusable integration code (API client, auth, parsing). It does **not** know about LangGraph — no `@tool` decorators, no node functions. That layer is added in the agent's `tools/`.

```
src/services/<service>/
├── __init__.py
├── client.py        # API wrapper (auth + fetch + send)
├── settings.py      # env vars, base URLs, scopes
├── prompts.py       # optional — only if the service ships canonical prompts
├── tools.py         # @tool-decorated wrappers ONLY if every agent uses them the same way
└── scripts/         # one-off CLI scripts (OAuth setup, manual ingest, …)
```

Rules:

- **Services don't import from agents.** Strict one-way dependency.
- If two agents need the same API call **but with different wrapping**, the call lives in `services/` and the wrapping lives in each agent's `tools/`.
- If you find a service growing agent-specific logic, extract that logic into an agent's `tools/`.

---

## 4. State design

State is the contract between nodes. Get it right and the rest of the graph reads naturally.

Use `TypedDict` (with `Annotated[..., reducer]` for accumulators) for ergonomic state, or Pydantic when you need validation. Keep state **minimal** — what each node needs to read or update, and nothing more.

```python
"""State and routing types for the email_assistant graph."""
from typing import Annotated, Literal, TypedDict
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """Working state for the email assistant graph."""
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    triage_decision: Literal["respond", "ignore", "notify"] | None
    inbound_email_id: str
    draft: str | None
```

Rules:

- **Use reducers** (`add_messages`, `operator.add`, custom) for accumulating fields. Replacement is the default; reducers are explicit.
- **No raw API responses in state.** Parse them in the node and put the parsed shape in state.
- **Don't stash secrets in state.** They go in `configuration` (LangGraph's configurable) or env vars.
- **Don't conflate transient with persistent.** Big intermediate artefacts go in the virtual filesystem (deep agents) or external storage, not in state. State is what the checkpointer persists at every step.

Full discussion + reducer cookbook — `references/GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 5. Nodes, edges, routing

Nodes are pure functions of state.

```python
"""Triage node: classifies the inbound email as respond / ignore / notify."""
from <agent>.schemas.states import AgentState
from <agent>.prompts.triage import TRIAGE_PROMPT
from <agent>.utils import call_structured_llm

async def triage_email(state: AgentState) -> dict:
    """Decide whether to respond, ignore, or notify on the inbound email."""
    decision = await call_structured_llm(TRIAGE_PROMPT, state["messages"][-1])
    return {"triage_decision": decision.kind}
```

Rules:

- **One concern per node.** If a node both fetches data and decides what to do with it, split it.
- **All I/O goes through `services/` or tool nodes.** Plain reasoning nodes call the LLM; they don't `requests.get(...)` directly.
- **Return only the keys you change.** LangGraph merges the dict into state; don't echo unchanged fields.

Routing functions are **separate** from compute nodes — name them `route_after_<phase>` and put them in `nodes/routing.py`:

```python
def route_after_triage(state: AgentState) -> Literal["draft", "notify", "__end__"]:
    """Pick the next branch from the triage decision."""
    match state["triage_decision"]:
        case "respond": return "draft"
        case "notify":  return "notify"
        case "ignore":  return "__end__"
```

Wiring lives in `graph_builder.py` — see `assets/template-graph-builder.py`. Edges should read like a sentence; if you can't say what the graph does in one paragraph, simplify.

---

## 6. Tools

Three kinds of tool surface, in order of preference:

1. **Pure tools** — no side effects, deterministic (search a vector store, parse a file). No approval needed.
2. **Read-side tools** — fetch data via a service (read inbox, list calendar events). No approval needed.
3. **Side-effecting tools** — change something in the world (send email, write to calendar, post to Slack). **Always** wrapped in `add_approval` outside dev mode.

Pattern (full template in `assets/template-tool.py`):

```python
"""Send an email via the Gmail service. Wrapped with approval in non-dev mode."""
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from services.gmail.client import GmailClient

@tool
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """Send an email. Returns the sent message id.

    Args:
        to: recipient email address
        subject: subject line
        body: plain-text body
    """
    return GmailClient().send(to=to, subject=subject, body=body)
```

Assembly + approval wrapping in `tools/base.py`:

```python
NEEDS_APPROVAL = {"send_email", "delete_event", "post_to_slack"}

def get_tools(dev_mode: bool = False) -> tuple[list, dict]:
    """Assemble agent tools; wrap side-effecting ones with approval outside dev mode."""
    tools = [send_email, read_inbox, search_messages]
    if not dev_mode:
        tools = [add_approval(t) if t.name in NEEDS_APPROVAL else t for t in tools]
    return tools, {t.name: t for t in tools}
```

## 7. Deep agents — when & how

Adopt the **[Deep Agents harness](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/harness)** (the `deepagents` package) when **two or more** of these are true:

- The agent runs for many turns / hours and accumulates significant context.
- The work decomposes into independent subtasks that benefit from isolated context.
- You need a virtual filesystem for shared scratch, drafts, or artefact handoff between turns.
- You want declarative permissions on what the agent may read / write.
- You need explicit, inspectable planning (a todo list humans can review).
- The work spans multiple sessions and the agent benefits from persistent memory.

If only one is true, a vanilla ReAct loop over a small `StateGraph` is usually simpler.

### Harness primitives — when each fires

| Primitive | Use when |
|-----------|----------|
| `write_todos` | Multi-step task; you want the plan to be inspectable & resumable. |
| `task` (subagent) | Subtask is large enough that its intermediate reasoning would crowd the main context, or it parallelises with peers. |
| Virtual filesystem (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`) | The agent produces durable artefacts (a draft document, a research report, code) that later steps will read. |
| Permissions | Always. Start with deny-by-default and an allowlist of paths. |
| `interrupt_on` | Any tool whose effect cannot be undone cheaply (send_email, delete_*, transfer_*, …). |
| Memory (`AGENTS.md`) | Long-running collaboration with the same user where preferences and conventions should carry over. |
| Skills | The agent should know how to do a class of task (e.g. "respond to support tickets") that has its own playbook. Load progressively, not in the system prompt. |
| Harness profiles | Per-model tuning (excluded tools, system-prompt tweaks). Keep model-specific config out of agent code. |

### Construction pattern (full template in `assets/template-deep-agent.py`)

```python
"""Deep agent build for <agent_name>. Composes a deepagents harness around our tools."""
from deepagents import create_deep_agent, FileSystemPermission
from <agent_name>.tools.base import get_tools
from <agent_name>.prompts.system import SYSTEM_PROMPT

tools, _ = get_tools(dev_mode=False)

permissions = [
    FileSystemPermission(operation="read",  path_pattern="/workspace/**", mode="allow"),
    FileSystemPermission(operation="write", path_pattern="/workspace/drafts/**", mode="allow"),
    FileSystemPermission(operation="write", path_pattern="**",            mode="deny"),
]

graph = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
    system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    tools=tools,
    permissions=permissions,
    interrupt_on={"send_email": True, "delete_event": True},
    memory=["./AGENTS.md"],
    # subagents=...  # omit to use the default general-purpose subagent
)
```

### Best practices

- **Don't disable the planning tool.** `write_todos` is cheap and pays for itself in inspectability.
- **Spawn subagents at clean task boundaries.** "Research X and return a one-paragraph summary" is a good subagent task. "Help me think about Y" is not.
- **Permissions deny-by-default.** Allow `/workspace/**` (or narrower) and explicitly deny everything else, including `.env`, `~/.ssh/**`, etc.
- **Interrupt on every side-effecting tool by default.** Loosen explicitly per environment (dev mode skips all interrupts).
- **Skills over fat system prompts.** If the agent's playbook for "handle a refund" is 300 lines, that's a skill, not a system prompt section.
- **AGENTS.md is for stable preferences and conventions.** Working state lives in the virtual filesystem; chat history is the checkpointer's job.
- **One harness profile per model.** Put per-model exclusions / system-prompt tweaks in a registered `HarnessProfile`, not in every agent.

## 8. Human-in-the-loop

Two HITL surfaces:

1. **Tool approval** — `add_approval(tool)` wraps a side-effecting tool. The graph pauses before the tool runs; a human approves, edits the args, or rejects.
2. **`interrupt_on` (deep agents)** — declarative gate at the harness level; same effect, configured per-tool centrally.

When to use which:

- **`add_approval`** for vanilla LangGraph graphs without the deep agents harness.
- **`interrupt_on`** for deep agents; it consolidates the gating config in one place.

Rules:

- The set of approval-gated tools is the same in production for every agent: anything that mutates external state.
- In **dev mode**, approval is off so iteration is fast. Dev mode is a runtime flag, not a code branch left in main.
- Approval prompts include the **tool name + arguments**. The reviewer should see what is about to happen without reading code.
- Rejected calls **never silently no-op.** They surface an error to the agent that lets it re-plan.

---

## 9. Testing

Three test surfaces — full layout in `references/TESTING.md`:

| Layer       | Path                    | What it tests                                                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit        | `tests/unit/`           | Pure functions: nodes, tools (with mocked services), routing, schemas, prompts. |
| Integration | `tests/integration/`    | Compiled graph end-to-end with fakes for the network; live runs against staging. |
| Notebooks   | `tests/notebooks/`      | Interactive walkthroughs — useful for debugging + onboarding, **not** CI gates. |

Required for every PR that touches nodes / tools:

- A unit test for the new / changed node, with mocked services.
- An integration test that runs the compiled graph for the affected branch.

Notebooks are explicitly **not** required and **not** in CI. They are a debugging aid.

---

## 10. Review checklist

Block a PR on:

- [ ] Each new file has a top-level docstring.
- [ ] Each new node / tool / public function has its own docstring (intent + args + returns).
- [ ] Nodes are pure functions of state — no direct I/O.
- [ ] Side-effecting tools are wrapped with approval (or `interrupt_on` in deep agents).
- [ ] State is typed; new fields have an explicit reducer if accumulated.
- [ ] Routing functions live in `nodes/routing.py`, named `route_after_<phase>`.
- [ ] `langgraph.json` updated when a new agent is registered.
- [ ] Unit + integration tests added for new nodes / tools.
- [ ] Deep agents: permissions are deny-by-default with an explicit allowlist; `interrupt_on` covers every destructive tool.
- [ ] No secrets in state, prompts, or test fixtures.

Comment-only (not blocking): prompt wording, naming bikesheds, optional eval scaffolding.

---

## Anti-patterns (do not do this)

- One mega-graph with every responsibility. Split by agent; each agent has one graph.
- Direct API calls inside nodes. Push them through `services/` (and a tool, if the LLM needs to invoke them).
- Untyped state (`state: dict`). Always `TypedDict` or Pydantic.
- Routing logic inside compute nodes. Routing lives in dedicated functions.
- Side-effecting tools without an approval wrap in production.
- Stashing large artefacts (full email bodies, file contents) in state. Use the virtual filesystem (deep agents) or external storage and pass a reference.
- Disabling `write_todos` to save tokens. It's an inspectability tool — keep it.
- Per-model branches in agent code (`if model == "gpt-4o": …`). Use a `HarnessProfile`.
- Putting setup secrets in prompts. They go in env / configuration.
