# MIS Next.js + FSD application standard

The contract for every MIS Next.js app:

1. **Folder layout is Feature-Sliced Design.** Code is organised by business meaning (`entities/`, `features/`, `widgets/`, `views/`), not by technical type (`components/`, `hooks/`).
2. **Imports flow downward only.** Higher FSD layers import from lower layers; same-layer cross-imports are forbidden.
3. **TypeScript is strict.** No `any`, no implicit `unknown`, no unchecked index access.
4. **Every file has a top-level docstring.** Every exported function, component, hook, and type has its own TSDoc block.
5. **Every callback passed to a React hook is a named function expression.** `useEffect(function syncUser() { … }, [userId])` — never an anonymous arrow.

When in doubt on any of these, open the matching reference:

## 1. Bootstrap a new app

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest <app-name> --typescript --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
cd <app-name>
```

Required choices: **App Router**, **`src/` dir**, **`@/*` import alias**, **TypeScript**, **ESLint**.

Then drop these in from `assets/`:

| Source                        | Destination          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| `assets/tsconfig.json`        | `tsconfig.json` (merge with the generated one) |
| `assets/eslint.config.mjs`    | `eslint.config.mjs`  |
| `assets/steiger.config.ts`    | `steiger.config.ts`  |
| `assets/directory-tree.md`    | keep open while scaffolding the first slices |

Install dev deps for the linters:

```bash
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-jsdoc eslint-plugin-import @feature-sliced/steiger-plugin steiger
```

Initial FSD scaffold (under `src/`):

```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router (routing only — no business logic)
├── views/                  # FSD views layer (page composers; thin wrappers)
├── widgets/                # Independent UI blocks composed from features/entities
├── features/               # User actions that deliver value
├── entities/               # Business entities (user, product, order, …)
└── shared/                 # Reusable infra (ui kit, lib, api client, config)
```

> ⚠️ **Do NOT create `src/pages/`.** Next.js reserves `src/pages/` for the legacy
> Pages Router. Having both `src/app/` and `src/pages/` causes Next.js to error
> at build/dev time (routing conflict). The FSD "pages" layer is named **`views/`**
> in this standard precisely to avoid that collision. Same rule applies at the
> project root — never create `pages/` alongside `app/`.

See `references/NEXT_APP_ROUTER.md` for how Next's `app/` interacts with FSD's `views/`.

---

## 2. Add a slice

A **slice** is one folder inside a layer — e.g. `features/login`, `entities/user`. Slices contain **segments**:

```
features/login/
├── index.ts        # public API — only these exports may be imported by other slices
├── ui/             # React components for this feature
├── model/          # state, business logic, types
├── api/            # backend calls for this feature
└── lib/            # utilities used only inside this slice
```

Rules:

- **Only `index.ts` is public.** Never reach into `features/login/ui/login-form.tsx` from outside the slice.
- **Same-layer cross-imports are forbidden.** `features/login` cannot import from `features/signup`. Push shared logic down a layer (to `entities/` or `shared/`) instead.
- **Upward imports are forbidden.** `entities/user` cannot import from any `features/*` or `widgets/*`.

Full layer + segment reference, with the allow/deny matrix — `references/FSD_LAYERS.md`.

---

## 3. Where does this file go?

Answer these in order:

1. **Is this a Next.js routing file (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `route.ts`)?** → `src/app/...` only. The body should be a thin composition of FSD slices; no business logic here.
2. **Is it a complete page composition?** → `src/views/<view-name>/` (FSD views layer — named `views/` rather than `pages/` because Next.js reserves `src/pages/` for the legacy Pages Router).
3. **Is it a self-contained UI block reused across multiple views (sidebar, header, command palette)?** → `src/widgets/<widget>/`.
4. **Does it implement a user-visible action with business value (login, send-message, add-to-cart)?** → `src/features/<feature>/`.
5. **Does it represent a business entity (user, product, order) with its model + base UI?** → `src/entities/<entity>/`.
6. **Is it generic reusable infra (button, formatter, http client, config)?** → `src/shared/<segment>/`.

If two answers fit, pick the **lower layer** (closer to `shared`). Pushing code down is cheap; pulling it up later is expensive.

---

## 4. Write a component or hook

Component file template — full version in `assets/template-component.tsx`:

```tsx
/**
 * @file features/login/ui/login-form.tsx
 * Login form: collects credentials, calls the auth feature's submit action,
 * surfaces validation + server errors inline.
 */

import { useState } from "react"
import type { LoginCredentials } from "@/entities/user"
import { submitLogin } from "../model/submit-login"

/**
 * Props for {@link LoginForm}.
 */
export interface LoginFormProps {
  /** Called once the server has accepted the credentials. */
  onSuccess: (userId: string) => void
}

/**
 * Renders the login form and orchestrates the submit flow.
 *
 * @param props - see {@link LoginFormProps}
 */
export function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {
  const [creds, setCreds] = useState<LoginCredentials>({ email: "", password: "" })
  // ...
}
```

Hook file template — full version in `assets/template-hook.ts`:

```ts
/**
 * @file features/login/model/use-login.ts
 * Hook that exposes the login submit action + its loading / error state.
 */

import { useState } from "react"
import type { LoginCredentials } from "@/entities/user"

/**
 * Tracks the in-flight state of a single login attempt.
 *
 * @returns submit handler plus `isPending` and `error` flags
 */
export function useLogin() {
  const [isPending, setPending] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)
  // ...
}
```

Naming conventions (full table in `references/TYPESCRIPT.md`):

- **Files:** kebab-case (`login-form.tsx`, `use-login.ts`).
- **React components & types:** PascalCase (`LoginForm`, `LoginFormProps`).
- **Functions, variables, hooks:** camelCase (`submitLogin`, `useLogin`).
- **Constants (module-level, immutable):** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- **Default exports:** **never**, except where Next.js requires them (`app/**/page.tsx`, `app/**/layout.tsx`, etc.).

## 5. Hooks with named functions

Every callback passed to a React hook is a **named function expression**, not an anonymous arrow.

### `useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect`

```tsx
// ❌ anonymous arrow — stack traces show "anonymous"
useEffect(() => {
  void fetchUser(userId).then(setUser)
}, [userId])

// ✅ named function expression — stack traces, DevTools, and the next reader
//    all see "syncUserProfile" immediately
useEffect(function syncUserProfile() {
  void fetchUser(userId).then(setUser)
}, [userId])
```

The name is a **verb phrase that describes the side-effect**: `syncUserProfile`, `subscribeToInbox`, `trackPageView`, `cleanupListeners`.

### `useMemo` / `useCallback`

```tsx
// ✅ describe what is being computed / handled
const filteredItems = useMemo(function computeFilteredItems() {
  return items.filter(i => i.matches(query))
}, [items, query])

const onSubmit = useCallback(function handleSubmit(e: FormEvent) {
  e.preventDefault()
  submit()
}, [submit])
```

### Async work inside `useEffect`

`useEffect` callbacks can't be `async`. Extract the async work into a **named inner function** and call it:

```tsx
useEffect(function syncUserProfile() {
  async function loadUser() {
    const u = await fetchUser(userId)
    setUser(u)
  }
  void loadUser()
}, [userId])
```

### Event handlers in JSX

`onClick={() => doThing()}` is acceptable when the handler is a one-liner. Anything multi-line is lifted out into a named function:

```tsx
function handleDelete() {
  if (!confirm("Delete?")) return
  void deleteItem(item.id)
}

return <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
```

Full rationale + ESLint rule that enforces it — `references/HOOKS_NAMED_FNS.md`.

---

## 6. TypeScript rules

The hard rules — full discussion in `references/TYPESCRIPT.md`:

- **Strict everywhere.** `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`, `noImplicitOverride: true`.
- **No `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow. The escape hatch is `// @ts-expect-error <reason>` with a written reason.
- **`import type` for type-only imports.** Keeps the compiled bundle clean and signals intent.
- **Path aliases via `@/`.** Cross-layer imports use `@/entities/user`, never relative `../../../entities/user`.
- **Discriminated unions over enums.** TS enums emit runtime code and don't tree-shake; tagged unions don't.
- **Validate at the boundary.** Anything from the network / URL / form goes through Zod (or equivalent) before it becomes a typed value. Inside the app, trust the types.
- **No barrel files in `shared/`.** Each slice has a public `index.ts`; `shared/` exports per-folder (`@/shared/ui/button`) to keep tree-shaking honest.

---

## 7. Docstring rules

Two mandatory levels — full guide in `references/DOCSTRINGS.md`:

### File-level (every `.ts` / `.tsx`)

Top of file, before imports:

```ts
/**
 * @file <fsd-path>/<file-name>
 * <one-sentence summary of what this file exports and its role in the slice>.
 */
```

### Function-level (every exported function, component, hook, type)

TSDoc block immediately above the declaration:

```ts
/**
 * <one-line summary in imperative mood>.
 *
 * <optional longer description, wrap at ~80 chars>
 *
 * @param <name> - <what it is, units / constraints if non-obvious>
 * @returns <what comes back; omit if void or trivially obvious>
 * @throws <error class> when <condition> — omit if no throws
 */
```

Non-exported helpers inside a file get a **single-line** docstring; full TSDoc only if behaviour is non-obvious.

The shared ESLint config (`assets/eslint.config.mjs`) enforces these via `eslint-plugin-jsdoc`.

## 8. Review checklist

When reviewing a PR in an MIS Next.js repo, block on:

- [ ] No anonymous arrow callbacks in `useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect` / `useMemo` / `useCallback`.
- [ ] No imports that cross FSD rules (upward, same-layer, or reaching past a slice's `index.ts`).
- [ ] No `any`. No suppressed errors without a written reason.
- [ ] Every new file starts with a `@file` docstring.
- [ ] Every exported symbol has a TSDoc block.
- [ ] No business logic in `src/app/**` — only routing and composition.
- [ ] No default exports outside Next.js convention files.
- [ ] Boundary input is validated (Zod or equivalent), not type-asserted.

Comment-only (not blocking): naming bikesheds, hypothetical extraction, minor doc wording.

---

## Anti-patterns (do not do this)

- Folders organised by technical type (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/utils`) at the top level. Use FSD layers instead.
- Importing from another feature: `features/login` ↦ `features/profile`. Push the shared logic down to `entities/` or `shared/`.
- Reaching past a slice's public `index.ts` (`@/features/login/model/foo`). Re-export from `index.ts` instead.
- Business logic in `app/<route>/page.tsx`. Pages are thin composers — move logic into the FSD `views/` slice or further down.
- Creating `src/pages/` (or `pages/` at the project root). This collides with Next.js's legacy Pages Router and breaks the build. Use `src/views/` for the FSD views layer.
- Anonymous arrow callbacks in hooks (`useEffect(() => …)`).
- `any` to silence the compiler. Narrow from `unknown` or fix the type.
- Default exports outside Next convention files. They make refactors and IDE rename harder.
- Files without a `@file` docstring.
- Type-asserting boundary data (`json as User`). Validate it.
