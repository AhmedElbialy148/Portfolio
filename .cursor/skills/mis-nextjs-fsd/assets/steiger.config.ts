/**
 * Steiger — FSD-aware architecture linter.
 *
 * Steiger enforces the layer & slice rules that ESLint's import plugin only
 * catches coarsely (e.g. same-layer cross-imports, public-API violations).
 *
 * NOTE on layer naming: the canonical FSD "pages" layer is named `views/` in
 * this project because Next.js reserves `src/pages/` for the legacy Pages
 * Router — having both `src/app/` and `src/pages/` makes Next.js error. We
 * alias the FSD layer name via `aliases` below so Steiger treats `views/`
 * as the pages layer for all of its built-in rules.
 *
 * Install:
 *   pnpm add -D steiger @feature-sliced/steiger-plugin
 *
 * Run:
 *   pnpm steiger ./src
 *
 * Wire it into the pre-commit and CI lint step:
 *   "scripts": {
 *     "lint:arch": "steiger ./src"
 *   }
