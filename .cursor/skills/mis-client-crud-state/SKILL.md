description: >-
  Frontend pattern for CRUD mutations without refetching lists — optimistic or
  in-flight row states plus local store patches from API responses. Use when
  implementing create, update, delete, or rename in client-hydrated lists,
  sidebars, tables, or when the user asks to avoid refetch after mutations.

# MIS client CRUD state

Prefer **local list state patches** over **refetch-after-mutation** when the UI already holds the collection and the mutation response (or submitted input) is enough to update it.

## When to use

| Situation | Patch local state | Refetch |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Create returns the new row (id, title, timestamps) | Prepend/append from response | Initial page load only |
| Update/rename with known final fields | `map` + merge patch | Never, unless server computes fields you don't have |
| Delete on success | `filter` out id | Never |
| Server derives opaque fields (counts, permissions, sort keys) | Partial patch + targeted refetch of **one** item or **one** scope | Scoped refetch only |
| Multi-tab / multi-user consistency is critical | Invalidate or refetch on focus | Full or scoped refetch |

Default for MIS app surfaces (sidebars, nested lists): **patch in the provider that owns the list**.

## Contract

1. **One store** owns the collection (`ProjectsProvider`, table context, etc.).
2. **Expose narrow mutators** — `addX`, `updateX`, `removeX` — not raw `setState` from widgets.
3. **Track in-flight rows** separately from the collection when the row should show a spinner:
   - Create: `pendingChat` placeholder before id exists
   - Update/delete: `mutatingChat` (or `mutatingIds`) keyed by stable id
4. **Mutation hook flow**:
   - Set in-flight marker → call API → patch store from response/input → clear marker
   - On error: clear marker only; do not patch
5. **No `refetch()` / `router.refresh()`** after success unless SSR-only surfaces still need it (prefer patching those from the same store).

## Per-operation patterns

### Create

```ts
setPendingRow({ projectId, title });        // instant sidebar row + spinner
const created = await api.create(body);
addRow(projectId, mapResponseToRow(created)); // use response id — no GET list
clearPendingRow();
navigate(`/…/${created.id}`);
```

### Update / rename

```ts
setMutatingRow({ id, operation: "rename", title: nextTitle });
await api.patch(id, { title: nextTitle });
updateRow(projectId, id, { title: nextTitle, updatedAt: now });
clearMutatingRow();
```

Show the **new title** on the loading row during rename.

### Delete

```ts
setMutatingRow({ id, operation: "delete", title: currentTitle });
await api.delete(id);
removeRow(projectId, id);
clearMutatingRow();
if (routeIsDeletedChat) navigate(parent);
```

Keep the row visible with a spinner until the DELETE succeeds, then remove it from state.

## UI rules

- In-flight row: spinner icon, reduced opacity, disable link and row menu.
- Dedupe: drop `pending*` row once the real id appears in the collection.
- Expand parent groups while a pending/mutating child exists so the user sees feedback.
- Button-level `isPending` is fine for dialogs; **row-level** state must use the shared store so the correct row loads.

## Anti-patterns

- `await refetch()` after every create/rename/delete when the API already returned enough data.
- `router.refresh()` to sync a client-hydrated sidebar — patch `getXById` consumers instead.
- Global `isPending` without row id — wrong row won't show loading.
- Optimistic patch before API **without** rollback on failure (in-flight marker only is safer for delete).

## Reference implementation (this repo)

| Concern | Location |
|---------|----------|
| List store + mutators | `features/projects/hooks/use-projects.tsx` |
| Create + pending row | `features/chat/hooks/use-create-project-chat.ts` |
| Rename/delete + mutating row | `features/chat/hooks/use-chat-mutations.ts` |
| Sidebar rendering | `widgets/producer-app/ProjectGroup.tsx` |

## Review checklist

- [ ] Success path patches local collection; no list refetch.
- [ ] In-flight state is keyed by id (or pending placeholder) and cleared on error.
- [ ] Response body fields used for create; submitted input used for rename when response is empty.
- [ ] Deleted row removed from state; navigation away if viewing deleted resource.
- [ ] Header/detail views read from the same store (`getChatById`) so patches propagate.
