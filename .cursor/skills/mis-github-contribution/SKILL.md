# MIS GitHub contribution workflow

The standard contribution model for every MIS repo. The goal is simple:

- Anything on `main` is in **production**.
- Anything on `dev` is integration-tested and on **staging**.
- Feature branches are **short-lived**, single-purpose, and cut from `dev`.
- Every commit and PR is **machine-readable** (Conventional Commits) so changelogs, release notes, and triage tooling work without human curation.

This file is the day-to-day decision tree. For depth on any one area, open the matching reference under `references/`. Reusable templates live under `assets/`.

| Topic | Reference |
|-------|-----------|
| Branching, environments, protection | `references/BRANCHING.md` |
| Commit message conventions | `references/COMMITS.md` |
| PR review etiquette & merge rules | `references/PR_REVIEW.md` |
| Pre-commit / lint / test gates per stack | `references/PRE_COMMIT.md` |

## Decision tree

Pick the action that matches the user's request:

| If the user asked to… | Go to |
|-----------------------|-------|
| Start a new feature or fix | [1. Cut a feature branch](#1-cut-a-feature-branch) |
| Commit work | [2. Write a commit](#2-write-a-commit) |
| Open a PR | [3. Open a PR](#3-open-a-pr) |
| Review a PR | [4. Review a PR](#4-review-a-pr) |
| Promote `dev` to `main` | [5. Promote dev to main](#5-promote-dev-to-main) |
| Set up a new repo | [6. Bootstrap a new repo](#6-bootstrap-a-new-repo) |

---

## 1. Cut a feature branch

**Base branch:** always `dev`, never `main`. `main` is production; `dev` is staging.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c <type>/<ticket-id>-<short-kebab-summary>
```

Branch types (the prefix is mandatory):

| Prefix      | Use for |
|-------------|---------|
| `feat/`     | New user-visible behaviour |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix |
| `chore/`    | Tooling, deps, config, housekeeping |
| `refactor/` | Internal change with no behaviour change |
| `infra/`    | Infrastructure, deploy, CI/CD |
| `docs/`     | Docs-only changes |
| `test/`     | Test-only changes |

Branch names are kebab-case and must include the ticket id when one exists. Examples:

- `feat/MIS-142-stripe-webhook-retry`
- `fix/MIS-189-null-user-on-signup`
- `chore/bump-node-22`

Keep branches alive for **hours or days, not weeks**. Rebase on `dev` daily to avoid drift.

For environment promotion and hotfix paths, see `references/BRANCHING.md`.

---

## 2. Write a commit

Format — [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <imperative summary, ≤ 72 chars>

<body — what changed and why, wrapped at 72 chars>

<footer — ticket refs, breaking-change marker>
```

Rules:

- **One commit per task or user story.** Squash WIP locally before pushing.
- **Imperative present tense:** `add`, `fix`, `update` — never `added` or `fixes`.
- **Reference the ticket** in the footer: `Refs: MIS-142` or `Closes: MIS-142`.
- **Breaking changes** get a `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` footer line. The PR title also gets a `!`: `feat(api)!: drop /v1 endpoints`.
- **Do not** add `Co-authored-by` trailers for AI agents. The author is the human who reviewed and merged.

Install the shared commit-message template once per machine:

```bash
cp assets/commit-template.txt ~/.config/git/mis-commit-template.txt
git config --global commit.template ~/.config/git/mis-commit-template.txt
```

Full type table, scope guidance, and worked examples — `references/COMMITS.md`.

## 3. Open a PR

**Target branch:** `dev` for normal work. `main` only for release-promotion PRs (see [section 5](#5-promote-dev-to-main)).

Before opening:

1. Rebase on the latest `dev`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git rebase origin/dev
   ```
2. Run the local gates — see [Pre-commit gates](#pre-commit-gates) below. CI runs the same gates; running locally first saves a round-trip.
3. Self-review the diff. Delete dead code, commented-out blocks, and stray `console.log` / `print` statements.

**PR title** uses Conventional Commits, same format as the commit:

> `feat(billing): add Stripe webhook retry (MIS-142)`

**PR body** uses `assets/pull_request_template.md`. Copy it to `.github/pull_request_template.md` in every repo so GitHub pre-fills the body. Required sections:

- **Summary** — what and why, 1–3 bullets
- **Changes** — bulleted list of notable changes (one per commit is fine)
- **Testing** — exact commands run + manual steps performed
- **Screenshots / recordings** — required for any UI change
- **Checklist** — lint, type-check, tests, docs, migrations, secrets
- **Ticket** — `Closes MIS-142`

Sizing: keep PRs **small and single-purpose**, ideally **< 400 LOC of net diff**. If a PR grows beyond that, split it before requesting review.

Merge rules and review SLAs — `references/PR_REVIEW.md`.

---

## 4. Review a PR

- First review within **one working day**.
- Be specific. Prefer GitHub "suggested change" blocks over vague asks.
- **Block on:** correctness, security, test coverage, public-API contracts.
- **Comment-only on:** style, naming bikesheds, hypothetical future refactors.
- Approve when it is good enough, not perfect.
- Authors must resolve every thread before merge.
- Do not force-push after approval without flagging it — pushes dismiss stale approvals automatically.

Escalation rules and CODEOWNERS behaviour — `references/PR_REVIEW.md`.

---

## 5. Promote `dev` to `main`

Promotion happens on a fixed cadence (default: weekly) or on-demand for a release. Open a PR titled:

> `release: promote dev → main (YYYY-MM-DD)`

Body: bullet list of the user-visible features / fixes since the last promotion, generated from the squash-merge commit log on `dev`:

```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..origin/dev
```

Required before merging the promotion PR:

- All CI green on `dev` for at least one full run after the latest merge.
- Staging smoke checks signed off (link to the run / checklist in the PR body).
- Migration plan documented if any migrations are included.

Use a **merge commit** (not squash) for promotion PRs so the individual feature commits remain visible on `main`'s history.

**Hotfix path** (bypass `dev`): branch `fix/<ticket>-hotfix-<summary>` off `main`, open PR targeting `main`, and immediately back-merge `main` into `dev` once shipped. See `references/BRANCHING.md`.

---

## 6. Bootstrap a new repo

Drop these files into a fresh repo to make it MIS-standard:

| Source (this skill)               | Destination in the new repo               |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `assets/pull_request_template.md` | `.github/pull_request_template.md`        |
| `assets/CODEOWNERS`               | `.github/CODEOWNERS`                      |
| `assets/commit-template.txt`      | `.gitmessage` (and `git config commit.template .gitmessage`) |
| `assets/pre-commit-config.yaml`   | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`                 |
| `assets/branch-protection.md`     | Apply settings via GitHub UI or `gh api`  |

Then:

1. Create `dev` from `main` and push:
   ```bash
   git switch -c dev && git push -u origin dev
   ```
2. Set `dev` as the **default branch** in repo settings so new PRs target it.
3. Apply branch protection to **both** `main` and `dev` per `assets/branch-protection.md`.
4. Install pre-commit hooks locally:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
5. Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repo that links back to this skill instead of restating the rules.

---

## Pre-commit gates

Every repo runs the same four classes of check, locally (via the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework) and again in CI:

1. **Lint** — language-appropriate (ruff / eslint / golangci-lint / etc.)
2. **Format check** — `--check` mode of the formatter (ruff format / prettier / gofmt).
3. **Type-check** — mypy / tsc / etc., where the language has one.
4. **Tests** — at minimum the affected package's unit tests.

The shared starter — `assets/pre-commit-config.yaml` — covers Python (ruff + mypy), TypeScript (eslint + tsc), and generic hooks (trailing whitespace, large-file guard, secret scan).

Per-stack details and CI mirroring — `references/PRE_COMMIT.md`.

---

## Anti-patterns (do not do this)

- Branching off `main` for a feature. Always branch off `dev`.
- Pushing directly to `main` or `dev`. Both are protected; the push will be rejected.
- Multi-purpose PRs ("misc fixes", "address review"). Split into focused PRs.
- WIP commit noise on the branch you intend to merge. Squash locally first.
- `--no-verify` to skip hooks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- `git push --force` to a shared branch. Use `--force-with-lease` and only on your own feature branch.
- `Co-authored-by` trailers for AI agents.
- Long-lived branches (> 1 week). Either merge or close.
